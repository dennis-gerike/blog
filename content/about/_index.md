description: Dennis Gerike - Test Automation Engineer
---

Hi, my name is Dennis Gerike.

Fifteen years ago I started my career as a web developer in Berlin.
I worked for different startups and professionalized in the then-common tech-stack of PHP, MySQL, HTML, CSS and JS.

After ten years in the business I switched my profession from writing code to testing it.
My main focus is on automating the annoying task of manually re-testing features (â†’ automated regression tests) and to improve the processes around it.

Over the years my favorite tools and frameworks have become Cypress, Xray and BDD:

* With Cypress, it has become very easy and very fast to write end-2-end tests.
Because of the easy interface, non-technical persons have a chance to learn it, even when they lack javascript knowhow. This allows for more diverse QA teams, where not everyone has to have a software development background.

* Xray is an excellent test management tool for Jira.
It handles manual and automated tests equally well.
The biggest strength is their great API, which allows to create very custom test automation solutions. 

* One of the main goals of BDD (Behaviour-driven Development) is to create a shared understanding between every involved person (QA, Dev, PO, Stakeholder, etc), so we avoid implementing the wrong thing.
When applying the BDD guidelines we get higher quality tickets and more useful acceptance criteria, which in turns produces better code and better tests.

My opinions about software engineering and quality are influenced (among others) by Dave Farley, Gojko Adzic and Robert C. Martin.
